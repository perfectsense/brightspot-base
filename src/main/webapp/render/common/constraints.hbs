Constraints are specific to bsp-forms. They provide additional
field validation after native HTML5 field validation passes.

For an example of a custom constraint,
@see https://github.com/perfectsense/brightspot-js-form/blob/master/src/js/constraints/bsp-form-constraint-matches.js

That custom constraint would be invoked by passing this data:
inputs: {
	myfield: {
		attributes: {
			id: "myfield"
		}
	},
	myfieldrepeat: {
		attributes: {
			id: "myfieldrepeat"
		},
		constraints: [
			{
				arg: "#myfield",
				name: "bsp-form-constraint-matches"
			}
		]
	}
}
--}}
{{#each this}}
	{{#if arg}}
		data-{{name}}="{{arg}}"
	{{else}}
		data-{{name}}
	{{/if}}
{{/each}}
