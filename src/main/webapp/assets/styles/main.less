 * Your LESS for your project goes at the bottom of this file, including any custom project variables, elements, mixins and components

/**
 * Our Main CSS file

// Wwe bring in our variables
@import (reference) "variables/variables.less";

// This brings in our mixins
@import (reference) "mixins/mixins.less";

// We bring in our utilities as a direct import, these include the normalize reset,
// the scaffolding, as well as basic and reponsive utilities. If we create more, we should consider them as reference
// or mixins, in order to not bloat the CSS too much
@import "utilities/utilities.less";


// Now that we have our vars, mixins and utilities, the real CSS starts

// First we import any bower CSS. This is for plugins that we bowers that have their own CSS
@import (inline) "bower/bsp-carousel/bsp-carousel.css";

// These are elements. Some of these correspond to DOM elements, others are small building blocks that components or parts of components can extend
// The primary difference is that elements do not have a component class wrapper and they are primarily used inside components, meaning that very
// rarely will you see an element just stand alone inside a page layout without being represented inside a component
@import "elements/buttons.less";
@import "elements/grid.less";
@import "elements/icons.less";

// Components should be ties into CMS components as closely as possible. It would be ideal to maintain a 1:1 relationship of components renderers to
// components LESS files so they are easy to identify, find, and modify
@import "components/article.less";
@import "components/blockquote.less";
@import "components/component.less";

@import "components/site-header-simple.less";

// The gallery module component goes last. It potentially has other components inside of it, so this lets us do some clean overrides
