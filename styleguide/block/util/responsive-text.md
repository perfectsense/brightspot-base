## ResponsiveText

A CSS-only technique for toggling the display between 2 strings based on CSS queries.

A typical use-case for this utility block is to show a lengthy title on large viewports, but show a shorter title when the viewport goes below a certain width.

Since your application will determine what the logic is to switch between the two strings, we don't provide a working example in Base. As a result, you'll want to take a look at `base/util/ResponsiveTextSample.less` for an example of how you'd implement your styles within your project.
