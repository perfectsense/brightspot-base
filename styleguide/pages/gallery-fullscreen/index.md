This full screen gallery page has a modifier class on the body. This allows this special full screen experience of this page.This allows the gallery full to expand/contract with the browser window size rather than let the image size determine the height of the gallery itself (as it does by default).

Since this is "full screen" and being shown as an example below, it will not look great unless you choose a screen size for it to fill (top right) or just open it in it's own window (click on `Index` above)
