Next is a title, optional subtitles (which can be links or images), and description text. Next up are two lists, a primary and secondary. These are a list of components, so they can be text, links, images, or other components. After that is a plain list of optional links. The last item in the bio content is the extra pictures. These are currently just a list of images. By default, there is a max of 6 images, after which they would drop to the 2nd row. After the bio content comes an optional list of social links in a justified layout.</p><p>We show the Bio component below in a two column layout, but with the default styles, it will stretch to fit any container. In the xs breakpoint, it stays with the same design, but shows 3 images at a time instead of 6.</p>"
